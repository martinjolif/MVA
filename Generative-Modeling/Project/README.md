# Generative modeling project 

Project in pairs for the Generative modeling course.

Study of the ["Plug-and-Play split Gibbs sampler: embedding deep generative priors in Bayesian inference
"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.11134) paper.

The paper propose a Plug-and-Play Split Gibbs Sampler (PnP-SGS) algorithm using a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model to solve imaging inverse problem like deblurring, inpainting and super-resolution.
We propose an implementation of this algorithm in this [repository](https://github.com/rialibb/Plug-and-Play-Split-Gibbs-Sampler).
