# Denoising score matching for diffusion models

Project in pairs for the Introduction to Probabilistic Graphical Models and Deep Generative Models course.

Study of 3 papers:
* ["A Connection Between Score Matching
and Denoising Autoencoders"](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~vincentp/Publications/smdae_techreport.pdf)
* ["Generative
Modeling by Estimating Gradients of the Data Distribution"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05600)
* ["Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic
Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239)

Our work was focused on the third paper and we proposed an experimentation on beta scheduling.
The report can be found here, moreover our experimentation is available on the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Juju85194/PGM_project_DDPM), where we compared the different beta schedulers in the case of image generation.
