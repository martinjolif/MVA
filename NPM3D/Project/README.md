# 3D Point Cloud and Modeling project 

Project in pairs for the 3D Point Cloud and Modeling course.

Study of the ["Efficient 3D Semantic Segmentation with Superpoint Transformer
"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08045) paper.

The paper propose a model based on superpoints to do 3D point cloud semantic segmentation.
We trained the model on two already available datasets (DALES & S3DIS). 
We also made some modification in the code to train it on the Paris-Lille-3D dataset. 
To do so, we forked the following repository:
