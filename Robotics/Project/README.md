# Robotics project 

Project in pairs for the Robotics course.

Study of the ["Towards Generalizable Vision-Language Robotic Manipulation: A Benchmark and LLM-guided 3D Policy"](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/gembench/) paper.

The paper propose two models which are able to solve tasks with a robot given text instructions.
We ran the first model proposed in the paper called "3D-LOTUS" and build our own task. To do so, we forked two repositories:
* [robot-3dlotus](https://github.com/martinjolif/robot-3dlotus)
* [RLBench](https://github.com/martinjolif/RLBench)

We also created a small [tutorial](https://github.com/martinjolif/robot-3dlotus/blob/main/create_evaluate_new_task.md) to create and evaluate its own task with the 3D-LOTUS model
