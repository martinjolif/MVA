# Project for the Reinforcement Learning course

The goal of the project is to design a control strategy which keeps a patient healthy while avoiding prescribing drugs at every time step.

To solve this problem I tried two different agents type: a random forest based Fitted-Q-Iteration (FQI) and a Deep-Q-Network (DQN) with a target network.
