# Generating Graphs with Specified Properties Kaggle Challenge

Group project for the ALTEGRAD course. This project was done as a kaggle challenge.

### Objective

The goal of this project is to explore and apply machine learning/artificial intelligence techniques to generate graphs with specific properties.

For example from the following sentence, 
"graph_0,This graph comprises 50 nodes and 589 edges. The average degree is equal to 23.56 and there are 3702 triangles in the graph. The global clustering coefficient and the graph's maximum k-core are 0.6226034308779012 and 18 respectively. The graph consists of 3 communities.
",
we want to generate a graph that respect these properties.


See this [repository](https://github.com/martinjolif/conditioned-graph-generation) to have more details on the methods used.
See the [kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/generating-graphs-with-specified-properties/overview) to understand better the data and the goals.
